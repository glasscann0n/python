You are asked to write a program to calculate the gross pay for a week of work from number of hours worked for a named employee, Federal income tax and social security tax payroll deductions and net pay for a single individual.  Show the name of the individual, their gross pay, each of these taxes and net pay.  Show no decimal places in all dollar outputs.
Background:
Background:
Gross pay (or gross income) is the number of hours worked times the hourly rate.   Neither of these is constant and 1-1/2 time applies to hours worked exceeding 40 hours but less than 50 hours per week.   For those employees working 50 hours or more per week, pay them double time.
Social security tax deduction is 6.2% of gross pay for any income for weekly incomes less than or equal to $2,000 per week.  No additional Social security tax is taken for those dollars exceeding $2,000.  so, the highest Social security tax paid is $124.
Refer to the table below for your Federal income tax deduction for single taxpayers only:
Gross income
Rate
Less than $500
15% of Gross Income
More than $500 but less than $1,000
20% of part of Gross Income exceeding $500 but less than $1,000 plus $75.00
More than $1,000
25% of part of Gross Income exceeding $1,000 plus $175.00
Refer to the table below for your Federal income tax deduction for married taxpayers only:
Gross income
Rate
Less than $800
13% of Gross Income
More than $800 but less than $1,900
18% of part of Gross Income exceeding $800 but less than  $1,900 plus $104.00
More than $1,900
22% of part of Gross Income exceeding $1,900 plus $302.00
 (These is in addition to social security tax.)
Net income is gross pay less each of these taxes.  You can design your program to re-use some of what you did for an earlier homework.
Test data.  Verify your Python programâ€™s results with desk checks on the last page.
